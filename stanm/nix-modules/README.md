To run, make sure you have a Google Maps API key in ~/.local/share/google-api/key.

You should have the Static Maps API enabled for it, as well as the Geolocation API.

Once that's done, run this in a dedicated shell, to have the map view update on
changes to .nix files:

```
nix-shell -p entr findutils bash --run \                                                                                                            7.9m î‚³ 14:55:39 2024-08-08 (Thu)
    "ls *.nix | \
     entr -rs ' \
     nix-build eval.nix -A config.scripts.output --no-out-link \
     | xargs printf -- \"%s/bin/map\" \
     | xargs bash \
     ' \
    "
```

This tutorial demonstrates the use of Nix modules. The default.nix file
includes marker.nix file includes the path.nix file. They build on top of each
other to produce the final app.
