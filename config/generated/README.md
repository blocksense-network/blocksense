# Auto-generated Blocksense config files

> [!WARNING]
> Do not edit these files manually.

This folder contains symlinks to the config files generated by Nix for the
Blocksense services running in [Process
Compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose). Nix generates these
files based on the currently active environment, which is one of those defined
in the [`nix/test-environments/`](/nix/test-environments) dir.

To make changes to the configuration, you should modify the corresponding
[`nix/test-environments/*.nix`](/nix/test-environments) file and run `direnv
reload` to regenerate the configuration files.

## Generated files

- `sequencer_config.json` - Configuration for the Sequencer service.
  - Corresponding Nix options path:
    `services.blocksense.sequencer`
- `reporter_config_<name>.json` - Configuration for each Reporter service.
  - Corresponding Nix options path:
    `services.blocksense.reporters.<name>`
