# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```sh
yarn hardhat help
yarn clean
yarn build
yarn test
yarn coverage
yarn size

# Run these two in separate shells:
yarn hardhat node
yarn deploy:local ./scripts/deploy-lock.ts
```
