# **Blocksense SDK: Verifiable Computation with Trusted Execution Environments**

## **1\. The Challenge: Accessing Privileged and Confidential Data**

A significant portion of the world's high-value data is not publicly accessible. It resides within protected corporate databases, behind authenticated APIs, or is subject to strict privacy regulations. For oracle services to interact with this data—such as a bank providing private transaction details for a compliance check, or a healthcare provider verifying a credential for an insurance claim—a fundamental challenge arises: how can a decentralized network trust that this privileged data has not been manipulated by the provider?

Simply sending the data is insufficient, as the provider could alter it. Exposing the access credentials (like API keys or passwords) to a decentralized network of oracle nodes is a non-starter from a security perspective. Blocksense addresses this challenge by integrating a hybrid trust model that combines the hardware-enforced isolation of **Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** with the mathematical certainty of **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**.

## **2\. The Solution: A Verifiable Chain of Trust**

The core of the solution is to create an unbroken, verifiable chain of trust that extends from a secure hardware enclave to the Blocksense network. This allows an oracle service to prove that a specific, audited computation was performed on privileged data without revealing the data itself or the credentials used to access it.

This is achieved through a multi-stage process, orchestrated by **BlocksenseOS**, a specialized, minimal operating system designed to run within TEEs.

### **2.1. The Primary Use Case: Trust-Minimized Data from Privileged Providers**

The most powerful application of this model is enabling data providers who have privileged access to information to serve that data to on-chain applications with strong integrity guarantees.

Consider a data provider who has access to a secure, impartial third-party system (e.g., a government database, a secure financial data feed). They want to provide data from this system to a Blocksense oracle script without revealing their access credentials.

The workflow is as follows:

1. **Deployment of an Audited Module:** The data provider deploys an audited, open-source software module into a TEE instance running BlocksenseOS. This module contains the logic to perform a specific task, such as querying the third-party system using embedded credentials. The hash of this audited code is made public.
2. **Execution in Isolation:** The TEE executes the module in a protected environment, completely isolated from the host system. The module uses its embedded credentials to access the privileged data and computes a result.
3. **Hardware Attestation:** The TEE's hardware generates a cryptographic **attestation**. This is a digital signature from the TEE's unique, manufacturer-provisioned private key. The attestation proves two critical facts:
   - **Code Integrity:** A specific piece of code, identified by its hash, was executed.
   - **Confidentiality:** The execution occurred within the secure, tamper-proof TEE.
4. **Wrapping Attestation in a ZK Proof:** The TEE attestation and the result of the computation are then used as inputs (witnesses) to generate a succinct ZK proof. This proof makes a simple, verifiable statement: _"I possess a valid TEE attestation which confirms that the code with hash \[known_code_hash\] was executed and produced the result \[computation_result\]."_
5. **On-Chain Verification:** This final ZK proof is what the oracle service submits to the Blocksense network. The on-chain verifier—an Objective Program on Blocksense—can quickly and cheaply verify this proof. The verifier only needs to know the public hash of the audited module; it never sees the TEE attestation itself or the provider's confidential credentials.

This process creates an unbreakable chain of trust. The TEE guarantees that the provider cannot manipulate the software after it has been audited and deployed, and the ZK proof guarantees that the attestation is valid. The result is a trust-minimized bridge between confidential off-chain data and the transparent, verifiable world of the blockchain.
