# **Blocksense SDK Documentation: The Object Model & Parallel Execution**

A core innovation of the Blocksense network, and the key to its "Boundless Throughput Engine," is its state architecture.[^1] Unlike traditional blockchains that rely on an account-based model, Blocksense employs an **object-centric model** inspired by the design of the Sui blockchain.[^2]

This design fundamentally changes how the network processes transactions, moving away from a sequential bottleneck to a massively parallel execution environment. Understanding this model is crucial for developers, as the way you structure your application's state directly impacts its performance and scalability on Blocksense.

## **The Problem with Sequential Execution**

Most blockchains, such as Ethereum, use an account-based model where the entire state of the network is represented as a single, large data structure.[^3] Smart contracts are accounts that hold code and data, and transactions modify this global state.

This model has a significant drawback: to prevent conflicts (like double-spending), transactions must be processed sequentially, one after another, and ordered into blocks.[^4] This creates a global queue where every transaction, regardless of what it's doing, has to wait its turn. This sequential processing is a primary cause of the throughput limitations and high fees seen on many networks.[^5]

## **The Blocksense Solution: A World of Objects**

Blocksense's state is not a single ledger but a collection of individual, programmable **objects**.[^2] An object is the basic unit of storage and can represent anything: a token, an NFT, a smart contract, or a complex data structure.[^4]

Each object has a globally unique ID and metadata that defines its properties and, most importantly, its **ownership**. This explicit declaration of ownership is the key that unlocks parallel execution.[^7]

### **Types of Object Ownership**

There are three primary ownership categories for objects in Blocksense:

1. **Owned Objects:** An object that is owned by a single external address (a user account). Only the owner can initiate a transaction that modifies this object. The vast majority of assets, such as a user's tokens or NFTs, are owned objects.
2. **Shared Objects:** An object that has no specific owner and can be read or modified by any user. Shared objects are the mechanism for creating collaborative applications where multiple users need to interact with the same state, such as a decentralized exchange's liquidity pool or an on-chain auction contract.
3. **Immutable Objects (Frozen):** An object that cannot be modified by anyone after it has been published. Smart contract packages (the code itself) are a prime example of immutable objects.[^3]

## **How the Object Model Enables Parallel Execution**

The power of the object model lies in making data dependencies explicit. Every transaction must declare upfront which objects it will access and how (read-only or read-write). This allows the Blocksense network to analyze the dependencies of all incoming transactions _before_ executing them.[^2]

The execution logic is simple but powerful:

- **If two transactions do not access any of the same objects, they are causally independent and can be executed in parallel without any possibility of conflict**.[^2]
- **If two transactions only read from the same immutable or shared object, they can also be executed in parallel**.
- **Only when two or more transactions attempt to _modify_ the same shared object is there a data conflict**. In this case, and only in this case, the network must order these specific transactions to ensure a deterministic outcome.[^4]

This approach is a paradigm shift from the **total ordering** of traditional blockchains to a more efficient **causal ordering**.[^10] Instead of ordering everything, Blocksense only orders the small subset of transactions that actually have conflicting dependencies.

### **The "Simulation-First" Pipeline**

This principle is put into practice by Blocksense's "Simulation-First Parallel Pipeline".[^1]

1. **Dependency Analysis:** The network receives a set of transactions and immediately analyzes their declared object dependencies.
2. **Parallel Simulation:** "Simulator" nodes attempt to execute all causally independent transactions in parallel. Since most transactions in a typical workload (e.g., peer-to-peer payments, NFT transfers) involve only owned objects, they can be processed concurrently with near-zero conflict.[^7]
3. **Conflict Resolution:** If a conflict is detected on a shared object, one of the conflicting transactions is simply postponed to the next execution batch. This process is extremely fast and efficient.[^1]

## **Benefits for Scalability and Developers**

This architecture provides transformative benefits for both network performance and the developer experience.

### **For Scalability:**

- **Massive Throughput:** By breaking the sequential bottleneck, Blocksense's throughput can scale horizontally with the addition of more CPU cores to validator nodes. This allows the network to achieve extremely high transactions per second (TPS), capable of supporting enterprise-grade applications.[^5]
- **Low Latency & Near-Instant Finality:** Simple transactions involving only owned objects (e.g., transferring a token to a friend) do not require complex consensus. They can be validated and finalized almost instantly, providing a user experience comparable to Web2 applications.[^6]
- **Reduced Network Congestion:** Because independent transactions don't have to wait for each other, the network is far more resilient to congestion, leading to more stable and predictable transaction fees.[^5]

### **For Developers:**

- **Fine-Grained State Management:** The object model gives developers precise control over their application's state. You can design complex systems as compositions of independent objects, which is often a more intuitive and secure way to model digital assets.[^2]
- **Performance by Design:** The model encourages developers to think about state contention. By architecting applications to minimize the use of shared objects, you can directly build more scalable and performant dApps. For example, a game might represent each player's inventory as an owned object and only use a shared object for a global leaderboard, ensuring that most in-game actions can be processed in parallel.
- **Enhanced Security:** The Move language, combined with the object model, provides strong ownership and access control guarantees at the language level, preventing entire classes of common smart contract vulnerabilities like reentrancy attacks.[^4]

By embracing the object-centric paradigm, Blocksense provides a foundation for a new generation of decentralized applications that are not constrained by the performance limitations of the past.
