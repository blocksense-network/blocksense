# Creating data feeds

## SDK Macro

The oracle macro's main purpose is to wrap everything related to WASM and WIT, so that implementing
oracle scripts using rust is more straightforward.

Usage:

```rust
use blocksense_sdk::{
    oracle::{Payload, Settings},
    oracle_component,
}
#[oracle_component]
async fn my_function(settings: Settings) -> Result<Payload> {
    unimplemented!()
}
```

## Oracle types

Currently we support request/response oracle scripts that receive `Settings` as parameter and should return
`Result<Payload>`

- `Settings` provide you with
  - An array of data feed IDs and data(String representation of the resource property from the data feed configuration).
  - An array of capabilities - IDs and data.
- `Payload` is the Oracle result which is an array of data feed results.
  - Numerical - `f64`
  - Text - `String`

## HTTP library

For an HTTP library we are using [The Spin Rust SDK](https://github.com/fermyon/spin-rust-sdk/tree/main)

Usage:

```rust
use blocksense_sdk::{
    oracle::{Payload, Settings},
    oracle_component,
    spin::http::{send, Method, Request, Response},
};

#[oracle_component]
async fn my_function(_settings: Settings) -> Result<Payload> {
    // Create the outbound request object
    let req = Request::builder()
        .method(Method::Get)
        .uri("https://random-data-api.fermyon.app/animals/json")
        .build();

    // Send the request and await the response
    let res: Response = send(req).await?;

    println!("{:?}", res);  // log the response
    // TODO(oracle developer): Properly transform the response into an array of data feeds results
    // that are going to be stored on the oracle smart contract.
    Ok(Payload {
        values: vec![],
    })
}
```

The Oracle Script SDK and more related documentation will be released soon. Check back here later, or follow us on [X](https://x.com/blocksense_) to get notified when it is available.
