# What is Blocksense Sequencer?

The Blocksense sequencer is a pivotal component within the Blocksense protocol responsible for aggregating, validating, and publishing data collected by reporters. It ensures the data integrity before it is published on the target blockchains.

## How Does Blocksense Sequencer Work?

The Blocksense sequencer processes data feeds by executing several key functions that ensure the reliability and trustworthiness of the data:

## Registry (Oracle Scripts)

- **Role:** Maintains a registry of all active oracle scripts.
- **Function:** Stores critical metadata for each oracle script, including:

- **Name:** The identifier of the oracle script.
- **Registration Time:** The timestamp when the oracle script was registered.
- **Slot Duration:** The time interval assigned for the oracle script to collect and report data.
- **Type of Processing:** The method used for data processing to aggregate the reports from the submitted reports.

## Periodic Reports Processing per Slot

- **Role:** Processes reports periodically based on the assigned slot duration.
- **Function:** Collects data from the reporters and compiles it into a structured data feed. This periodic processing ensures that the data is up-to-date and reflects the most recent information collected by the reporters.

## Data Feed to Publish

- **Role:** Prepares the validated data feed for publication.
- **Function:** The compiled and validated data feed is formatted and readied for transmission to the blockchain. This step ensures that only accurate and verified data is forwarded.

## Sender to Ethereum Networks

- **Role:** Transmits the validated data feed to target Ethereum networks.
- **Function:** Sends the data feed to multiple Ethereum-based blockchains (such as Ethereum, Gnosis, and Polygon). This step finalizes the data publication process, making the data available for consumption by decentralized applications and smart contracts on these blockchains.

## Diagram Description

- **Registry (Oracle Scripts):** Contains metadata about each oracle script, ensuring proper management and tracking.
- **Periodic Reports Processing per Slot:** Aggregates and validates reports from reporters in a timely manner.
- **Data Feed to Publish:** Prepares the structured and validated data for publication.
- **Sender to Ethereum Networks:** Transmits the data feed to the designated EVM networks for consumption.

The Blocksense sequencer integrates these components to maintain the integrity and accuracy of data feeds, leveraging cryptographic methods and game-theoretic incentives to ensure that the data published on the blockchain is reliable and trustworthy. This structured approach enhances the overall functionality and security of the Blocksense protocol.
