# Noir Compiler

At Blocksense, weâ€™ve enhanced the Noir programming language and compiler with
advanced tools designed to simplify and strengthen the creation of secure,
verifiable circuits. Our current prototypes include:

  1. [Noir time-travel debugging](https://noir.blocksense.network/noir_tracer)
  in the [CodeTracer](https://github.com/metacraft-labs/codetracer)
  environment;

  2. [formal
  verification](https://noir.blocksense.network/noir_formal_verification) of
  Noir circuits, based on the Z3 SMT solver and the IR language of the [Verus
  project](https://github.com/verus-lang/verus); and

  3. [Noir compilation
  support](https://noir.blocksense.network/noir_plonky2_backend) for the
  PLONKY2 proof system.

All of these developments are expected to reach a production-ready status in
the future. We plan on merging them with the upstream codebase as soon as they
are accepted by the Noir team.

The Blocksense Noir compiler follows the development of upstream Noir closely
and it should be fully compatible.
