## How Does Blocksense Work?

### 1. Data Feed Collection

- **Internet Real World Data**: Sources from the internet, such as APIs, websites and other data services, provide raw data for processing.
- **Reporters**: Nodes in the Blocksense network fetch, process and report data from these sources. Multiple reporters work in parallel to ensure redundancy and reliability. They execute predefined scripts or algorithms to process collected data and package it into a report.

### 2. Reporting and Aggregation

- **Reporters**: Publish the obtained value and are rewarded.
- **Sequencer**: Aggregates reports from multiple reporters and sequences them into structured transactions.

### 3. Sequencing and Validation

- **Creating Transactions**: Validated reports are aggregated and packaged into transactions ready for publication on the target blockchains.

## Ensuring Timely Updates

- **Assignment**: In the Blocksense node software, feeds are assigned to ensure timely updates. While the specific feeds change, the roles of reporters and sequencers remain fixed. This committee of reporters and sequencers handles different feeds without altering their roles, securing consistent and efficient data feed management.
- **Reporters**: Are given a fixed time slot in which they must compute the required values and send them to the Aggregator to avoid slashing.
- **Aggregators**: Package updates into bundles for re-broadcasting.
- **Block Builders**: Combine bundles into final blocks for publication.

## Creating New Data Feeds

New data feeds can be written easily using the **Blocksense SDK**. Oracle scripts can be bootstrapped with initial funds and become self-sufficient through on-chain data access fees. The protocol supports various types of oracles, from simple URL contents to complex GPU scripts for ML inference.
