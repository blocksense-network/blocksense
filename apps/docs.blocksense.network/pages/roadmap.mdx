# Roadmap

## Introduction
This roadmap outlines our strategic plan for the development and implementation of Blocksense, a decentralized and permissionless protocol for oracle data feeds. Our goal is to provide transparent and accurate data feeds efficiently and securely at the lowest possible cost.

## Goals and Objectives
Our primary objectives are to:
- Develop a solid and secure oracle network using ZK rollup technology.
- Ensure data accuracy through cryptographic and game-theoretic mechanisms.
- Provide scalable and cost-effective data feed solutions for various blockchains.

## Milestones
- **Q1 2024**: Release of Blocksense node software and oracle definition SDK.
- **Q2 2024**: Testnet launch with initial set of data feeds.
- **Q4 2024**: Mainnet launch and token distribution.
- **Q1 2025**: Integration with additional blockchains and expansion of data feed offerings.
