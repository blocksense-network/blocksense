# How Does Blocksense Reporter Work?

The Blocksense reporter is a major component in the protocol that secures the accurate and timely collection, processing, and reporting of data from various internet sources. The following details outline the reporter's functionality:

## Dispatcher

- **Role:** The dispatcher is responsible for selecting and executing a subset of oracle scripts randomly.
- **Function:** This random selection ensures that the data collection process is secure and unpredictable, reducing the risk of manipulation. The dispatcher initiates the process by assigning specific oracle scripts to be executed.

## Anomaly Detection

- **Role:** Each selected oracle script is passed through an anomaly detection module.
- **Function:** The anomaly detection module verifies the data collected by the oracle scripts for any irregularities or unexpected values. This step is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the data. Reports generated from this process are flagged if anomalies are detected, ensuring only valid data proceeds.

## Report Generation

- **Role:** The data processed by the anomaly detection module is compiled into reports.
- **Function:** These reports consolidate the validated data into a structured format. Each report represents a comprehensive and accurate snapshot of the data collected from the internet sources.

## Posting Reports

- **Role:** The final step involves posting the compiled reports.
- **Function:** Once processed, the reports are sent through HTTP to this reporterâ€™s assigned sequencer.

## Data Flow Diagram

The diagram above illustrates the workflow within the Blocksense reporter component:

### Dispatcher
- Selects and executes a subset of oracle scripts randomly.
- Ensures security and unpredictability in data collection.

### Anomaly Detection
- Monitors the data collected by each oracle script.
- Detects and flags any anomalies in the data.

### Report Generation
- Compiles validated data into structured reports.
- Ensures accuracy and reliability of the data.

### Posting Reports
- Sends compiled reports to the central system.
- Prepares data for aggregation and publication.

## Diagram Description

- **Dispatcher:** Selects and executes a subset of oracle scripts randomly.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Ensures data integrity by detecting anomalies in the collected data.
- **Report Generation:** Compiles processed data into structured reports.
- **Posting Reports:** Transmits reports for aggregation and further processing.

This structured approach within the Blocksense reporter verifies that data collected from various internet sources is accurate, reliable, and ready for integration into the Blocksense protocol, maintaining the overall integrity and functionality of the system.
