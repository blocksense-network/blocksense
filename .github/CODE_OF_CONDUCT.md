# Code of Conduct

At Blocksense, we are committed to fostering an inclusive, collaborative, and innovative environment for developers, contributors, and community members. Whether you're building oracle scripts, improving the protocol, or engaging in discussions, we expect all participants to follow these guidelines:

### 1. **Respect and Inclusivity**

â€¢ Treat everyone with **respect and professionalism**, regardless of experience level, background, or perspective. <br>
â€¢ Discrimination, harassment, or any form of toxicity will not be tolerated. <br>
â€¢ Foster a **welcoming space** where new and experienced builders can collaborate.

### 2. **Open Collaboration**

â€¢ We believe in **permissionless innovation**â€”share knowledge freely and support others in their contributions. <br>
â€¢ Give **constructive feedback** and be open to different viewpoints. <br>
â€¢ Respect other developersâ€™ work and contribute **in good faith**.

### 3. **Ethical and Responsible Development**

â€¢ Write **secure, transparent, and efficient code**â€”Blocksense is a public good, and your contributions impact the ecosystem. <br>
â€¢ Do not engage in or promote **malicious activities**, such as exploits, data manipulation, or unauthorized access to systems. <br>
â€¢ If you discover a **vulnerability**, report it responsibly rather than exploiting it.

### 4. **No Spam, Scams, or Self-Promotion**

â€¢ Avoid **spam, irrelevant advertisements, or self-promotion** in technical discussions. <br>
â€¢ Contribute meaningfullyâ€”this is an **open-source community, not a marketing platform**.

### 5. **Follow Licensing and Contribution Guidelines**

â€¢ Ensure your contributions align with **Blocksenseâ€™s licensing policies** and respect open-source best practices. <br>
â€¢ When submitting code or documentation, follow the **repositoryâ€™s contribution guidelines** for clarity and consistency.

### 6. **Lead by Example**

â€¢ Whether youâ€™re a core contributor, developer, or community member, **set a positive standard for others**. <br>
â€¢ Help **newcomers**, encourage participation, and uphold the values of **decentralization, transparency, and trust**.

By participating in this project, you agree to adhere to this Code of Conduct. Violations may result in removal from discussions, repositories, or the community.
