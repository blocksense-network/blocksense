# Security

At Blocksense, security is **paramount**. As a **permissionless oracle network**, we ensure that real-world data is **trust-minimized, verifiable, and resistant to manipulation**. Our security model leverages **game-theoretic incentives, cryptographic proofs, and decentralized validation** to maintain data integrity.

### ⚠️ **Responsible Disclosure**

If you discover a **bug, vulnerability, or security risk**, we urge you to **report it responsibly**. Please avoid disclosing security issues publicly before we can implement a fix.

📩 **Report vulnerabilities at:** `security@blocksense.network`

### 🚨 **Best Practices for Builders**

- **Always verify oracle data** before executing critical smart contract logic.
- **Use multiple data sources** to reduce dependency on a single feed.
- **Follow secure coding practices** when integrating the Blocksense SDK.
- **Monitor updates** for the latest security patches and improvements.

Blocksense is committed to **continuous security improvements** and working with the community to **build the most robust oracle infrastructure in web3**. Stay vigilant, stay decentralized, and let's **build a trustless future together**. 🚀
